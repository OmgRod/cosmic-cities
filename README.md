---

## About

**Cosmic Cities** is a retro-inspired space exploration game built with the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework.  
Wander derelict ships, manage your systems, and uncover the mysteries of the void.

> Think 2D pixel sci-fi with open-ended design, a bit of atmosphere, and room to grow.

## Features (WIP)

- Custom pause & save system
- Room transitions using `windfield` and `sti`
- Basic player movement and camera tracking
- Modular map loading and object collisions
- Future goals: terminals, inventory, mission scripting, hostile AIs
